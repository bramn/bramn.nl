# What Bram wears

While I do not care that much of what you think I (should) wear, I do want to share some things I wear, because sometimes people ask for it or give me compliments ðŸ˜‡


## Wants to wears:

Not in my closet, but on my wishlist are the following wearables:

![Cottonbureau Shirt](cottonbureau_shirt.png)
- This nice, colorful but mostly nerdy t-shirt, which is official merch from [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co): https://cottonbureau.com/p/URUZFW/shirt/front-end-friends-cascading-style-sheets#/19399692/tee-men-standard-tee-natural-100percent-cotton-m
- Also, more LIGER! But these shirts are just too expensive for my taste. Always on the lookout for a SALE though.
